## Overview 

Find burger shop  is a mobile application designed to help burger  lovers find  their favorite shops . At its core, Find burger shop  will use real-time location data to dynamically display the location of food shops near the user’s location.

## Related Work

This is a web version of the mobile application I have proposed for my project. The site is built using MongoDB, Node.js, and Express, with Handlebars templating. The Express server provides an API which to create and authenticate user accounts, retrieve burger shops listings from Yelp, and a static menu. I plan to use these APIs to serve data to the mobile application I will be building this course.
